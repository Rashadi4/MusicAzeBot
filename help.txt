I am DMusicBot a bot focus in searching music for you.
If you want to listen to music online I will search the song's Youtube link for you.
If you want to download the music I will also search the song's download link for you!

You can control me by sending these commands:

/search "track name" - search the track's youtube link (the track must exist in spotify)
/usearch "track name" - search the track's youtube link
